{"body":"Excellent piece by Nash. Jason (like many people who deal with us) seems to be increasingly hoping that nobody has actually gone through what he has said in the past that may make his statements look like BS. \n\nBut it only goes to show the fallacy of blaming the neutrals argument which has persisted since Kuchera and others levied against Tito on the GameJournoPros chat exchanges, since Chu levied at David Pakman during his coverage of the GG events, and most recently among many opponents of GG that have sprung up in the past few months.\n\nStriving to be neutral in regards to viewing an event does not imply that they support what one side or the other has done. Many neutrals either don't want to get involved and take a side because they don't feel they have enough information to make an informed choice, they don't believe either side is in the right, or they believe that its not their business to get involved as anything other than an observer.\n\nI mean, blaming neutrals for simply trying to view two sides of a debate (of which the opposition claims there is only one side) seems akin to Fascist or Nazism models of thought than anything else. No wonder neutrals are finally getting sick of this shit.\n\nOn a side note, implicit support by being neutral could go both ways. Do we claim every neutral supports Randi Harper and her harassment of suspected GG supporters or legitimate GG supporters online? Or that all neutrals support pedophilia if they want to see Nyberg's side of events? No, we say those things if they actually do say they support those people.","author":"Templar_Knight07","created_utc":"1448312423","subreddit_id":"t5_33726","link_id":"t3_3tz3em","parent_id":"t3_3tz3em","score":"55","gilded":"0","id":"cxakehe","subreddit":"KotakuInAction"}

{"body":"This is horseshit - JB Mortgage bought this debt for pennies on the dollar and now they're suing the homeowners to collect on the original debt of $5.2M plus interest since 1990 for a total of $60M. This is a blatant money grab and JB Mortgage are fucking bottom feeders.\n\nWhat will almost certainly happen is that the handful of homeowners who have title insurance will have their title insurance company pay JB Mortgage the original price of what they paid for their homes when they bought them. Depending on how many of these homeowners have title insurance, it will almost certainly be much more than what JB Mortgage paid for this very old, very bad debt. \n\nBased on the age of these houses, I'd estimate they were originally worth somewhere around $100,000. If you assume probably 1/2 of the 400 people have title insurance they're probably looking at a (200 people * $100,000) $20M payout on debt they probably paid less than .10/$ for ($520,000).\n\nFigure a couple of million in attorney's fees (or more likely, a percentage of the take) and this is a great con. They'll sue all the title companies they can find and get their easy payouts. If they are as scummy as they sound, they'll probably also sue all the rest of the people without title insurance and just get a default judgement on the ones who don't show up in court, and a quick settlement with the ones who do. Put a lien on the houses of people who don't pay and collect whenever the houses are sold.\n\nThese people need to lobby their Federal and State Representatives to get legislative relief for this action. If they do that, and they get some more news coverage and perhaps one or two of their Representatives to make some noise and introduce a bill - I'd bet California-based JB Mortgage would take the money from the title insurance companies and drop the lawsuits against everyone else.\n","author":"rabel","created_utc":"1446656550","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhn5","link_id":"t3_3rhl1b","parent_id":"t3_3rhl1b","score":"33","gilded":"0","id":"cwob0mj","subreddit":"Austin"}
