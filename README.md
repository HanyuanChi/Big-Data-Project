Reddit Comment Analysis using Spark (N-grams and Recommendation System)
- Project Final Report.pdf : Final Report for this project

- author_mapping : mapping of authors to IDs (this is required for implementing the recommender systems on Spark as well as Mahout) -- too large to upload to github
- subreddit_mapping : mapping of subreddits to IDs (this is required for implementing the recommender systems on Spark as well as Mahout)
- sample_datafile: sample of the data that was used for the analysis. Contains 100 rows from one of our files. This is to test out codes

- Complete-Codes.txt : complete codes used for this project. They are arranged according to the portion of the project they were used for
- getdata.sh : shell script to get the data from our Cloud Storage source(Google Big Query). It is shared publicly so you should not have trouble running this script.
